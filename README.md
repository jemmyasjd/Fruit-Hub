## What it Does !! ðŸ‘·

Fruit-Hub is a web application designed to provide users with an effortless way to purchase fresh fruits online. Users can browse through a wide variety of fruits, selecting their preferred items based on their needs and preferences. The platform integrates multiple payment options, allowing users to choose the method that best suits them. Additionally, we have implemented secure payment gateways to ensure a seamless and safe transaction process.

## How I Build ðŸ”§

- **Frontend Development:** We developed the frontend using React, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- **Authentication:** For user authentication, we integrated Clerk, providing a secure and streamlined login and registration process.
- **Backend Development:** The backend was built using Node.js, with MongoDB as the database to store and manage user data, orders, and inventory.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** We implemented GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), automating the testing and deployment process.
- **Cloud Deployment:** The application is hosted on AWS, ensuring scalability and reliability.
- **Dynamic Data Handling:** Data is dynamically fetched from the backend and displayed on the frontend, providing users with up-to-date information on available fruits.
